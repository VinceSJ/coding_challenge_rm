# Given a list of strings containing only values "fizz", "buzz" or "fizzbuzz", determine if there exists a sequence
# of numbers that will return the given string when run through the function from Q1. If such a sequence exists,
# determine the shortest such sequence. - If no such sequence exists, return an empty list: [] - If the sequence
# exists, return a list that is the shortest sequence: e.g., [9, 10] for an input of ["fizz", "buzz"]. - If multiple
# shortest sequences exist (consider that ["buzz", "fizz"] can be created at shortest length of 2 with both [5,
# 6] and [20, 21]), return the sequence with the lower starting number: e.g., in this case we would return [5,
# 6] for ["buzz", "fizz"]


wordlist = ['fizz', 'buzz']
